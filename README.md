### Universal Infrastructure Audit & Efficiency Engine

**Developed by Aquaflux Tech (Tanzania)**

**Axiom Pump Auditor** is a high-precision diagnostic platform designed to quantify energy waste and hydraulic inefficiency in industrial water utility infrastructure. Powered by the **Axiom RE Physics Kernel**, it provides engineers with actionable data to optimize 3-phase asynchronous pump systems.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Efficiency Decoupling:** Isolates Motor performance from Pump "Wet End" performance using IEC standard load curves.
* **Financial Impact:** Real-time OpEx waste calculation in local currencies (TZS, KES, USD).
* **Grid Quality Diagnostic:** Monitors Phase Imbalance (NEMA Standard) and Voltage Stability.
* **Professional Reporting:** Generates downloadable **Signed PDF Audit Reports** for field decision-making and investor verification.
