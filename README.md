### Universal Infrastructure Audit & Efficiency Engine

**Developed by Aquaflux Tech (Tanzania)**

Axiom Audit is a high-precision diagnostic platform designed to quantify energy waste and hydraulic inefficiency in industrial water utility infrastructure. Powered by the **Axiom RE Physics Kernel**, it provides engineers with actionable data to optimize 3-phase asynchronous pump systems.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Efficiency Decoupling:** Isolates Motor performance from Pump "Wet End" performance using IEC standard load curves.
* **Financial Impact:** Real-time OpEx waste calculation in local currencies (TZS, KES, USD).
* **Grid Quality Diagnostic:** Monitors Phase Imbalance (NEMA Standard) and Voltage Stability.
* **Professional Reporting:** Generates downloadable audit reports for field decision-making and investor verification.

## 🛠️ Usage & Deployment
This tool is optimized for **Streamlit Cloud**.
1. Input motor nameplate data (Rated kW).
2. Enter real-time gauge readings (Amps per Phase, Volts, Pressure).
3. Run the Diagnostic to identify waste and potential ROI.

## ⚖️ Licensing & Intellectual Property
* **Application UI:** Licensed under **GNU GPLv3**.
* **Physics Engine:** Powered by the **Axiom RE Kernel** (Protected under APL-1.0).
* **Company:** Developed by **Chacha Mwise / Aquaflux Tech (Tanzania)**.
